	<h1>Analog Staff (Cody McLaughlin and Ilan Kleiman)</h1>
	<p>One being the creative and the other being the brains.<br/> Ilan; knowing 5+ different programming languages (HTML-CSS, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, and learning Java). His personal website being: <span style='cursor:pointer;text-decoration: underline;color:blue !important;' onClick='visit("ilan")'>IlanKleiman.com</span><br/> Cody, isn't as good as a programmer as Ilan; although, more of an innovative designer. He knows HTML, Python, and CSS (learning Perl). He is more of the person whom develops the ideas for this website and other projects. Though being an well-advanced programmer, he still has much to learn.</p>
